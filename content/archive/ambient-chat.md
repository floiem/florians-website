# Ambient Chat

A chatbot that generates answers to your questions.

Ambient is a browser-based application that generates answers to your questions. It is designed to be simple and intuitive, while is also powered by GPT-3, a state-of-the-art language model. This project was created before the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

### Challenge

How can I create a chat application that is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly? And how can I integrate GPT-3 to create a chatbot that feels authentic and natural?

### Action

#### Organizing my codebase

Before diving into development, I spent time blueprinting my application in FigJam to plan out the structure of my classes and components. I found this to be a crucial step in creating a clean and organized codebase. By breaking down the application's functionality and visualizing the various components that would be necessary to achieve it, I was able to streamline the development process and ensure that everything would connect seamlessly.

#### Refining the user experience

After building the frontend and backend components, I moved on to styling the application using CSS. I found it important to ensure that the design was both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. I also focused on making the application responsive, so it would look great on all devices. Once the styling was complete, I dockerized the application to make it more scalable and efficient. This also made it easier to deploy and manage, which was a big plus for me. For the database, I decided to use Airtable API, which allowed for easy integration with my application. I found that Airtable provided a simple and intuitive way to manage and store data, which made it a great choice for my project.

### Result

Around 100 people have used the application on the experimental version. I also received positive feedback from people who tried it out, the most favourite feature being the chatbot.
