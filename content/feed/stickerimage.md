# stickerimage.com â€“ The small laptop sticker customizer

![stickerimage](/images/feed/stickerimage/memoji-laptop-community.jpg)

I've been working on a small project in the last 48 hours. It's called [stickerimage.com](https://stickerimage.com) and it's a small laptop sticker customizer. You can upload your own Memoji, add stickers, and customize the position and rotation of it.

It got a lot of attention on X, so thanks everyone for checking it out. I built it for fun, there is no further intention or business model behind it. If I build something real, I'll let you know.
