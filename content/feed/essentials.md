# Three everyday life things

Sharing things that I commonly use in my everyday life. I want to set this in contrast to the listings other people are doing on their website, because I just take things with _real benefits_, not just things that _look fancy_.

When I attend meetings, good headphones are necessary. I have decided to not buy the Apple AirPods Max as they were not updated, still have a lightning adapter, and are quite pricy. As an alternative solution, I've bought the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones. They have super good noise canceling, look great, and are easy to use with Apple devices. The quality is not as good as you're probably used to from Apple, but I'm super happy with them:

I need coffee in the morning, but when I moved to Berlin, I wasn't able to bring my coffee machine with me. Instead of buying coffee to go every day or making coffee manually, I bought coffee concentrate from TryMoin. I think it with OatMilk which tastes super nice:

Being in stress makes me sometimes forget things. Especially when I'm doing something in a routine, like going to shower. Instead of leaving my stuff in my room, in the bathroom somewhere, or simply somewhere, I decided to put everything into a bag that had a hook. I always hang it on the heating:
