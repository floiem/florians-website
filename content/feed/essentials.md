# Two things I use every day

Sharing things that I commonly use in my everyday life. I want to set this in contrast to the listings other people are creating on their website, because I just take things with _real benefits_ for myself, not just things that _look fancy_.

When I attend meetings, good headphones are necessary. I have decided to not buy the Apple AirPods Max as they were not updated in years, still have a lightning adapter, and are quite pricy. As an alternative solution, I've bought the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones. They have super good noise canceling, look great, and are easy to use with Apple devices. The quality is not as good as you're probably used to from Apple products, but I'm super happy with them:

I need coffee in the morning, but when I moved away from my old apartment, I wasn't able to bring my coffee machine with me. Instead of buying coffee to go every day or making coffee manually, I bought coffee concentrate from a brand called TryMoin. I drink it with OatMilk which tastes super nice, and definitely helps me to wake up:
