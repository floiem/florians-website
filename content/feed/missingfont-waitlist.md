# missingfont.com â€“ Waitlist launched for early access

![missingfont Waitlist](/images/feed/missingfont-waitlist/waitlist-image.jpg)

missingfont, an upcoming project Nils ([@nilseller](https://x.com/nilseller)) and I ([@flornkm](https://x.com/flornkm)) are working on, is now open for early access sign-ups. We're building a platform for designers and developers to find and share fonts. Not only a Google Fonts alternative, but a tool that makes it a lot easier to find and try out new fonts.

We have a lot of ideas which we are currently evaluating and we're excited to share more about it in the upcoming weeks. If you're interested in early access, sign up on [missingfont.com](https://missingfont.com) and we'll notify you when it's ready for you.
