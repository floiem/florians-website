## About this project

### General

This is the third big iteration of my personal website. I made my first one in 2019 and am hosting the files on GitHub since the beginning of 2022.

I'm a `design engineer`. That means, I'm both a creative and a logical thinker trying to combine both skills in one job.

### Copying this project

## Start locally

### 1. Copy repo

Fork / Download this repository so you have the files locally.

### 2. Install all dependencies

Make sure you have installed all necessary dependencies with `npm run install`

### 3. Start the development server

Start the development server with `npm run dev`. Please note that some features, like the letter stack of the community won't work as it fetches necessary data over a [Vercel API](https://vercel.com/docs) endpoint.

An active wifi connection is required as some features like localization might not work without.

## Contributing

You are free to contribute to the project whether by opening Issues or by forking this repo and opening a PR. I appreciate any help and feedback – please don't be angry if I'm not going to implement your feedback. It is most likely because I've decided to do something on porpuse.
