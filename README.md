## About this project

This is the third big iteration of my personal website. I made my first one in 2019 and am hosting the files on GitHub since the beginning of 2022.

I'm a `design engineer`. That means, I'm both a creative and a logical thinker trying to combine both skills in one job.

### Copying this project

Although this repository is public, I'd like to ask you to not 1:1 copy my whole website. You can use it as a template /starting point, but please change the content and design to your own needs.

### Map of the site
