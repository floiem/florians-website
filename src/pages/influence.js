                By far the biggest influence on me had my friends and family. I really think, that having the right people around you is the most
                important thing in life. I would not have the skills I have today, if it wasn't for them. Support is the one thing, but getting
                criticism and honest feedback is the other. This is what helped me the most.

                Kind of obvious and I am sure that many people will say the same, but Apple has always been a huge inspiration for me.
                Not only in terms of design but more in terms of how they were able to create an ecosystem that is so unbelievably well
                thought through.

                Of course, there is no way around Lego. I grew up with it and it was the first time I was able to create something on my own.
                As a child, I can remember always loved the feeling of freedom combined with creating something not just as art, but rather
                something that has a deeper meaning behind it.

                The name of a Youtube channel showcasing what you can do with design. Nowadays, the designs are not relevant to what I do anymore,
                but I discovered the channel when I was 12. It influenced me to start designing. Sadly, the person behind the channel took his own
                life in 2014. I wanted to especially mention this because his legacy lives on and I am sure that he has influenced many people in
                the same way he influenced me.
