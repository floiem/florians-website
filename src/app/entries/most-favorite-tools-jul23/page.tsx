                Retro is a social media platform allowing you to post imagery
                based on the weeks of the year. While I don&apos;t think the
                world needs another social media app, I find it quite refreshing
                to use something new to share what I&apos;m doing on some days.
                Some other things I like the app for are, that they have a very
                nice UI and that inviting friends is easy. Looking forward to
                seeing how the app is being maintained in the future.

                Every password has to be different. One rule that I find somehow
                important when creating new accounts on different platforms.
                That, it comes that you can&apos;t remember all passwords and
                need a password manager. I would wish the native Apple solution
                was more flexible in terms of Browser support and syncing, but
                sadly right now it&apos;s not yet at the point I would like to
                use it mainly. Because my old password manager wasn&apos;t
                supported anymore by ARM-based devices, I had to search for
                another solution and found NordPass. I like their design,
                it&apos;s free to use and they have a good extension â€“ I&apos;m
                happy with it.

              <p className="mb-6">
                At the end of the month, I wanted to go to a concert-like event
                with some friends. I couldn&apos;t attend it sadly so I had to
                sell my ticket for it. Instead of eBay or similar platforms,
                I&apos;ve used TicketSwap for it. While they might have fees on
                their platform, I found the User Experience when creating the
                offer extremely well made. In no time I was able to offer my
                ticket, saw transparently how much I get back from it, and the
                ticket sold after a few hours.
