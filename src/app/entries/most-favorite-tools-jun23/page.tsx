                Let&apos;s begin with Cron. It is a simple, yet powerful
                calendar that I use to schedule and maintain appointments,
                lectures and other events. It is really easy to use and has all
                the necessary features I need to organize my day.

                To be honest, as a design-development hybrid (and not just a
                software developer), I never thought GitHub has other usable
                features than just beingâ€¦ a hub for Git, especially for smaller
                teams. I knew about issues, but not in this detail. Managing
                your repo with GitHub issues is a great way to keep track of
                your work and collaborate with your team. Definitely worth a
                try!

                . Missive is a great mail client for teams. It is very easy to
                use and has a lot of great features. I especially like the fact
                that you can assign mails to other people and that you can
                easily see who is working on what.
