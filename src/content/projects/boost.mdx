title: Boost
date: Q1 2023 - Now
shortDescription: Nutrition application & hardware device
description: Boost is a prototype of an innovative digital product and app designed and developed with Ionic React, NodeJS Express, and Prisma. The product seamlessly integrates with the app, allowing users to track their daily nutrient intake and receive personalized recommendations based on factors such as weather and step count. As a digital product designer, I had the opportunity to work on Boost's prototype and develop its design, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Challenge

The challenge was, that altough most people are taking supplements, they often don't
know how much they should take. Additionally, shelfs are full of different supplements
and people often don't know which one is the best for them.

## Action

### Research

First of all, we had to make a survey to find out what people
thought about the current state of the nutrition industry. We
also had the intention of finding out what people are taking
as supplements and in what form. Our survey was made with the
help of Airtable so we could easily analyze the data
afterwards. In our research we found out that people are
taking supplements in the form of pills, powders, and liquids,
but when they could choose, they would prefer to take them in
the form of a drink or powder because it is more convenient.

### Vertical Prototyping

In the vertical prototyping phase, we had to create a hardware
prototype that is close to the final prototype. The goal was
to test the hardware and see if it works as intended. We
started by testing different motors and found out that the
Nema 17 stepper motor was the best option for our prototype.
We also had to send and receive data from a quickly made
Frontend to the Backend. We used the Arduino IDE to program an
ESP32 and used a NodeJS Express server to receive the data. We
also made a quick Frontend to send the data to the Backend.
Our tech stack for the project was made clear, we were going
to use Ionic React for the Frontend, NodeJS Express for the
Backend, and Prisma for the database.

### Frontend

When researching and discussing our Frontend, we came to the
conclusion that it would be best, if we develope a application
that is completely usable without having to connect to a
device. This way, we could test the application without having
to make a hardware prototype first. We started by building the
whole application in Figma as a fully functional prototype. We
then started building the application in Ionic React from
scratch. At this time, we also already set up the Backend and
the database. We used Prisma to generate the database models
and used Planetscale for its hosting. We used Render.com to
host the Backend. We have connected the application with Apple
HealthKit and OpenWeather API to get the user's location and
weather data for calculating the user's daily vitamin intake.

### Hardware Device

In our hardware, we incorporate a total of seven stepper
motors, along with a selection of sensors, a circular display,
and two ESP32 controllers. Our system is designed to
efficiently transmit and receive data via HTTP requests,
utilizing a range of libraries to ensure seamless control of
all components. By opting for HTTP requests, we prioritize
reliability in our product design and aim to offer a highly
realistic user experience.

## Result

Our prototype was shown on the University Exhibition and
received a lot of positive feedback. People told us they would
use the app and device if it was available. We also were invited
to present our project at a Startup Accelerator.
