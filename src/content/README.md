# The source for the website content

Here I've collected all the necessary content for my website. The content is written in Markdown or JSON.

## Markdown

Markdown files get converted to JSX elements using [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/).

## JSON

JSON files are used directly (and therefore ignored by Contentlayer) to provide data for the website. For example on the Creations page.
