# Flos most favorite tools: February 2023 edition

Here are my 3 most favourite tools in February 2023.

## Supabase

**From database to user authentication**

We began developing a new update for our app. We decided to use Supabase as our backend. Not only is Supabase extremely easy to use, but it also has a very intuitive design. Supabase comes with a lot of different features that are helping us to fulfill our needs. Personally, I just can recommend anyone to use Supabase, even if you are just starting out or used to Firebase.

## Cosmos

**A new way to save and look at your favorite things**

Cosmos is a relatively new platform and browser extension. It is a little bit like Pinterest, but it is more focused on curating your own little universe in a very easy and mindful way. The design is extraordinarily good and it has a free version. I am looking forward to using it for saving my favorite findings from around the internet. I just can recommend it to everyone, but make sure to install the browser extension because it will make your experience a lot better.

_Thanks [Linus](https://linusrogge.com/) for recommending this app!_

## Rive

**Creating animations intuitively**

Rive is a tool I know for a while now, but because I was so used to Lottie, I never really used it. But recently I started to use it more (see the animation on my About page). Rive is a tool that allows you to create animations in a very easy way. The big benefit, in my opinion, is that their own format is extremely small and can be used in a lot of different ways. You can also create your designs directly in their editor and then switch to the animation tab and create your animations. It is also possible to create animations directly based on mouse movements or other interactions.
