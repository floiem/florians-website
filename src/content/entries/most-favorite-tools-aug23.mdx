### Flighty

**Extremely well designed flight-app**

<div className="bg-zinc-50 dark:bg-zinc-950 w-full py-8">
  <img

    alt="Flighty Passport"
    width="200"
    className="mx-auto"
  />
</div>

While taking two flights this year, I've used Flighty to track my flights. It is
one of the apps that gave me the most joy while using it. The design, live activities
and realtime information is accurate and gives such a good user experience.

### Postman

**Test and build API requests**

When it comes to using REST APIs, Postman is my go-to tool. It's easy to use, has a lot of features and is free. In a concrete example, I've used it to build the Feed for my website where I'm fetching data from Youtube and GitHub and then combining it into one feed.

### AlDente

**Battery saver for MacBooks**

My MacBook is most of the time connected to a power source. This, as already known from a lot of studies, is not good for the battery. AlDente is a tool that helps you to keep your battery healthy by limiting the charging to a certain percentage. Altough it hasn't the best design or user experience, it is defenitely so benefitial for me, that I wanted to mention it here. I've bought the Pro version, but I would say the free version is enough for most people.
