# The Web in the Future

What will the internet look like in the future?

## The different stages

Web 1.0 was an era full of hyperlinks without any additional visuals or functions. When Web 2.0 came, most websites we know today (or not) were born. For example, Facebook (now Meta), YouTube, Twitter, and a lot more. These websites not only implemented CSS and JavaScript, they were also some of the first platforms that allowed users to interact with each other and for that reason track their data. Around the time these platforms got famous, in my perspective around 2010, Bitcoin was already a thing. But it was not until 2017 that it got really popular. Many tech-people used the term "Web 3.0" to describe the next stage of the internet. But what does that mean? And what will the internet look like in the future?

## Web 3.0 is misleading

The term "Web 3.0" is often used in combination with crypto. But I don't think that this makes sense. I don't hate crypto, but I think because of the recent events (FTX) a lot of things will change, and crypto will get much more regulated. Therefore, I think cryptocurrencies will not be the main focus of the next stage of the internet. I think the main focus will be on decentralization, artificial intelligence, and future technologies like quantum computing.

## Which problems will be solved?

Today we have a lot of problems on our planet. Not only the climate change, but also the fact that we are running out of resources. We need to find a way to produce more food, energy, and other resources. But we also need to find a way to produce them in a sustainable way. I think the internet will play a big role in solving these problems. We will be able to use more AI and other technologies without having to buy new computers, because they are running on the cloud. You can see this movement already today, when you look at the rise of Artificial Intelligence like GPT-3. We will also be able to use more energy-efficient technologies, because we will be able to produce more energy. I think the internet will also play a big role in the future of space travel. If humankind is going to get multiplanetary, we will need to use the internet to communicate with each other and to share data, even across different planets. Installing software will become more and more unpopular, because we will be able to use the internet to run our software. A new technology that will deal as a Gamechanger is Webassembly. Webassembly is a new technology that allows you to run code in the browser. This means that you can run code in the browser that was not written in JavaScript. This will allow us to use more languages in the browser, which will make it easier to use more powerful languages like Rust or C++.

For the Enduser, I think argumented reality will play a big role. For example, to fix cars. You will be able to see the problem in the car and fix it with the help of a virtual assistant. I think the internet will also play a big role in the future of education. We will be able to learn more and faster, because we will be able to use Artificial Intelligence for our children. I think the internet will also play a big role in the future of medicine. We will be able to diagnose diseases faster and more accurately. You don't need to go to the doctor anymore, because you can use the internet to diagnose yourself with a computer that is controlled over the cloud, extremely fast, and developed to recognize diseases.

I am very excited about the future of the internet, and I am looking forward to seeing what the next stage of the internet will look like.
