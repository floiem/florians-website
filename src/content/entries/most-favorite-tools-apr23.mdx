Here are my 3 most favourite tools in April 2023.

## Raycast AI

**Use ChatGPT directly in Raycast**

If you're looking to boost your productivity, Raycast is an excellent tool that I've already written about. Recently, they released a new feature called Raycast AI, which enables you to utilize ChatGPT directly within Raycast. This is an incredibly efficient way to use AI without the need to open a new application or tab.

## Arc Mobile

**Simple yet advanced browser**

I've been an Arc user on my Mac for quite some time, and I'm thrilled to see that they've launched a mobile version. It's a sleek browser with an attractive design, and it also includes some impressive features, particularly for tab management.

## Vercel

**The platform for Frontend Developers**

You're probably already familiar with Vercel, but I wanted to give it a quick shoutout since I've been using it extensively myself. Throughout April, I relied heavily on Vercel for deploying my projects.
