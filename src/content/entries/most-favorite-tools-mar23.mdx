Here are my 3 most favourite tools in March 2023.

## Posts

**Twitter, but for designers and developers**

Posts is a mobile application made by the team behind ReadCV. It is a platform that's built for designers and developers to share their work, photos, and thoughts.

## Revolut

**Intelligent, easy to use banking app**

While I don't use Revolut as my main bank or trading app, I use it for managing my money while I am studying. The app lets you easily view insights, round up your purchases, and manage your money in a very easy way.

## Fig

**Terminal with superpowers**

Fig is not an extra application; it is more like an addition to your terminal. It extends the terminal with a lot of useful features like autocomplete, which is very useful for working more efficiently. You can install it via Homebrew, and it has a free plan.
