Here are my 3 most favorite tools in 2022.

## Airtable

Airtable is a tool which you can use for a variety of different things. It is a database, a spreadsheet, a kanban board and much more. It is a very powerful tool and it is very easy to use. I use it for my blog, my finances and surveys. A lot of people use it for project management. I think that Airtable is a very underrated tool.

## Raycast

Raycast is a tool that allows you to control your computer with your keyboard more efficiently. It has a great developer community and you can extend the basic software even more with plugins. I use it to control my computer, to search for files and to control my music player. It is a very powerful tool and I use it every day.

## Notion

With Notion you can create notes. But it is even more than that, you can easily create a website with it. You can also create a database and a kanban board. It is very powerful and I use it for my studies, my To-Do lists and everything I am managing.

## Arc

Arc is a modern browser that gives you a unique experience. It is based on chromium and it is very fast although it gives you a lot of features on top. You can manage your tabs more efficiently, you can use a dark mode and you can use a lot of extensions. I use it as my main browser.

## Figma

Figma is basically a tool that allows you to create designs for websites and apps. It is most commonly used for User Interface Design. But I am using it as a replacement for Photoshop and a lot of other tools because you can, thanks to the plugins, do a lot of efficient things with it.

## Vercel

Vercel is a tool that allows you to host your website for free. It is very easy to use and it is very fast. I use it to host my blog and my website. It is a very powerful tool and I am very happy with it.

## Splitbee

Splitbee is a tool that allows you to track your website. It has a stunning UI and gives you a lot of cool features. You can use it as an alternative to Google Analytics.

## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is a tool that has written some of the code for this article. It is a tool that allows you to write code faster. I am happy with it and it helps me a lot.
