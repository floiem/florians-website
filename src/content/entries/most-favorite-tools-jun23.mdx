Here are my 3 most favourite tools in June 2023.

## Cron

**Business Calendar**

Let's begin with Cron. It is a simple, yet powerful calendar that I use to schedule and maintain appointments, lectures and other events. It is really easy to use and has all the necessary features I need to organize my day.

## GitHub

**Use it for more, than just a hub for Git!**

To be honest, as a design-development hybrid (and not just a software developer), I never thought GitHub has other usable features than just being… a hub for Git, especially for smaller teams. I knew about issues, but not in this detail. Managing your repo with GitHub issues is a great way to keep track of your work and collaborate with your team. Definitely worth a try!

## Missive

**A great, simple mail client for teams**

I've also learned about Missive from working at [inlang](https://inlang.com/). Missive is a great mail client for teams. It is very easy to use and has a lot of great features. I especially like the fact that you can assign mails to other people and that you can easily see who is working on what.
