### Retro

**A mix between BeReal and Instagram**

Retro is a social media platform allowing you to post imagery based on the weeks of the year. While I don't think the world needs another social media app, I find it quite refreshing to use something new to share what I'm doing on some days. Some other things I like the app for are, that they have a very nice UI and that inviting friends is easy. Looking forward to seeing how the app is being maintained in the future.

### NordPass

**A free and simple password manager**

Every password has to be different. One rule that I find somehow important when creating new accounts on different platforms. That, it comes that you can't remember all passwords and need a password manager. I would wish the native Apple solution was more flexible in terms of Browser support and syncing, but sadly right now it's not yet at the point I would like to use it mainly. Because my old password manager wasn't supported anymore by ARM-based devices, I had to search for another solution and found NordPass. I like their design, it's free to use and they have a good extension – I'm happy with it.

### TicketSwap

**A fast way to sell tickets for events you won't attend**

At the end of the month, I wanted to go to a concert-like event with some friends. I couldn't attend it sadly so I had to sell my ticket for it. Instead of eBay or similar platforms, I've used TicketSwap for it. While they might have fees on their platform, I found the User Experience when creating the offer extremely well made. In no time I was able to offer my ticket, saw transparently how much I get back from it, and the ticket sold after a few hours.
