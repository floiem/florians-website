Here are my 3 most favourite tools in May 2023.

## Unavatar

**The ultimate Avatar API**

Unavatar is a service that allows you to retrieve avatars for your users from many different sources. It's a great way to add a personal touch to your app or website. The best part is that you can access the images via a simple URL and that it is completely free to use.

## Screen Studio

**Simple recording software for stunning product demos**

Screen Studio is a screen recorder that has features like zooming, highlighting, and much more built-in. The videos are looking high quality, and I use it mainly for product demos. The software itself costs some money, but it's worth it in my opinion.

## Tailwind CSS

**Not really a tool, but I want to mention it anyways**

As you probably know, Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Nowadays, I use it very often because it just saves me a lot of time. I also really like the Tailwind colors and their awesome community and documentation.
